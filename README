h1. Syntax highlighting using pygments

This plugin adds syntax hightlighting to textpattern. You can embed code in
articles. The plugin is based on "Pygments":http://pygments.org/. 

h2. Installation

Note that the installation procedure is still a bit complicated.

# Enable support for Python CGIs on your webserver
# Copy @pygmentize_cgi.py@ to @textpattern/lib@
# Install the textpattern plugin in the usual way
# Create @pygmentize_cgi.cfg@ in @textpattern/lib@ and configure whitelistRegex 
  in order to select files that are allowed to be highlighted

h3. Troubleshooting

It might be quite difficult to get Python CGIs work on your web server. You
might want to try @virtualenv@ and changing the shebang of @pygmentize_cgi.py@
to an appropriate interpreter on your server installation.

As soon as you got CGIs to work, make sure that @pygmentize_cgi.py@ works as
expected. Verify this by calling it directly like this:
