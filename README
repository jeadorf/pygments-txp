h1. Syntax highlighting using pygments

This plugin adds syntax hightlighting to textpattern. You can embed code in
articles. The plugin is based on "Pygments":http://pygments.org/.

h2. Installation

# Install python on your webserver
# Install pygments on your webserver
# Generate copy&paste plugin data using 'make plugin'
# Install the plugin in the usual manner
# (optional) Install the
 "pygments-snippet-filter":http://bitbucket.org/jeadorf/pygments-snippet-filter
 plugin for pygments on your webserver

h3. Troubleshooting

If you run into troubles, simply ask! Here are some tips that might help:

* Verify that pygmentize is correctly installed and accessible from the server's shell
* Make sure '/usr/bin/pygmentize' is available. If you have a local python environment
  (e.g. _virtualenv_) you have to specify the script location manually in
  '&lt;textpattern&gt;/textpattern/config.php' in the variable $txpcfg['pygmentize'].
* When in doubt: do not waste time and ask. That might save you some time.
* Make sure that your Pygments installation supports the language of the file you
  want to highlight.

h2. Usage

For embedding highlighted code in a textpattern article, use the tag *&lt;txp:pyg_highlight /&gt;*.
It supports the following parameters:

* *file* - The name of an uploaded file in &lt;textpattern&gt;/files. Paths are
    not allowed. File names are restricted to alphanumerical characters,
    underscores, dots, and hyphens. Files must not begin with a dot.
* *linenos* - Enables line numbers. If set to 'inline' the line numbers are shown
    within the code box otherwise outside of the box. See Pygments reference for
    further information as this value is directly passed to Pygments.
* *from* - The first line to be displayed. This only works if the
    pygments-snippet-filter plugin is installed on your server.
* *to* - This line and all lines beyond are not displayed. This only works if
    the pygments-snippet-filter plugin is installed on your server.

h3. Examples

pre. <txp:pyg_highlight file='join.sql' />
<txp:pyg_highlight file='oca.ml' linenos='inline' />
<txp:pyg_highlight file='NotTheIsland.java' linenos='table' />
<txp:pyg_highlight file='ramide.py' from='3' to='14'/>
